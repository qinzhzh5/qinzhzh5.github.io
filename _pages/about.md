I am a third year graduate student from [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://spa.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans/page/25),[SYSU](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). My research interests include planetary system dynamics and computational astrophysics, with a focus on using simulations and theoretical approaches to explain observational phenomena in astrophysics.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Assco.Prof. Shangfei Liu](https://spa.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans/teacher/148) focusing on the dynamics of different exoplanetary systems and their potential observational effects. We are currently working towards preparing our findings for publication.
